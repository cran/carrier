Description: Sending functions to remote processes can be wasteful of
    resources because they carry their environments with them. With
    the carrier package, it is easy to create functions that are
    isolated from their environment. These isolated functions, also
    called crates, print at the console with their total size and can
    be easily tested locally before being sent to a remote.
